## Git Branches
Branches should be names in this conventions:
`this_is_my_example_branch`

Branches are to be **deleted** after the feature they are built for have been created and merged into staging.

`master` - for stable releases only. An entirely new feature page should be pushed to master once it is error-free and done testing. **Master must be updated weekly**</br>

`staging` - for all features that are currently done and tested, does not need to be a complete page. Please send merge requests to staging once issues/features are complete.</br>

`corrections` - for incorrect code that may need to be refactored, or complete an issue. This is only for corrections once the initial branch has been deleted.</br>

## Coding Practices - Naming Conventions

### **Variables && Classes**
CLASSES should be named as such:

Java Class: `ThisIsAnExample` </br>
Layout Resource: `this_is_an_example.xml`

### **Packages**
Packages should be named as such:
`ThisIsMyPackage`

### **Variables**
Should use our common camel casing as used in class for the last 2 years.

# COMMENT COMMENT COMMENT COMMENT 
## Comment everything well and completely so anyone can use and manipulate your code if needed in case of emeregencey or mixture of tasks.

# ALWAYS USE YOUR OWN BRANCH ONLY PUSH YOUR BRANCH ASK SOMEONE TO TEST YOUR BRANCH WITH STAGING (WHICH SHOULD BE STABLE) THEN CREATE A MERGE REQUEST AFTER ITS BEEN APPROVED BY ATLEAST ONE OTHER PERSON TO GO TO STAGING ONLY STAGING IS OUR "WORKING" MODEL WHERE OUR TESTED INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES WILL MEET. MASTER WILL ONLY BE STABLE VERSIONS AFTER STAGING IS DEEMED STABLE.
# WE WILL MAKE MERGES IN TO MASTER AS A GROUP INCASE ERRORS ARISE EVERYONE WILL BE THERE TO EXPLAIN OR FIX THEIR CODE!!!!!!
