		String help = "\tConcert Tracker is a personalized piece of software designed to allow the user to keep track of their past concert experiences.  This is done by continually adding in the content the individual consumes and allowing the software to run analytics on this data.  It displays useful and creative information in which the user will find fun and exciting in many ways.  From just remembering an experience they may have forgotten, jogging their memory to remember an experience they may have otherwise forgotten.  Or the new data that the software displays that the human brain isnâ€™t powerful enough to process, such as a compilation of cities and concert attended in ratio.  The years attended and the genres, as well as other metrics to be added along through future iterations.  The usage of data storage and manipulation allows us endless possibilities in bringing you the user new experiences, and allows you to never forget these memories.  \n\n\tIf you have experienced any problems or BUGS with our software please report them to: \n\nfakeEmail@fakedomain.com \n\n\tAnd if you have any suggestions please contact our development team here at:\n\n pleaseGiveUsFreeIdeas@thankYou.ca.";
